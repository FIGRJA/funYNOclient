This project involves porting the YNOproject website to an EasyRPG-based Windows application (including the multiplayer game functionality and all related features).
This project exist without YNOproject knowledge. And that's why I create it for myself and only for myself. Use it at your own risk.
(_I will write about this project in more detail in the future_)
### My plans
[ ] learn c++ and GO
[ ] analyzing the [YNOserver](https://github.com/ynoproject/ynoserver) backend and drawing up a work plan
[ ] writing the functionality
